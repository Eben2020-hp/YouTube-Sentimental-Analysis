This was heart touching. Even though we are in the 21st century, our women still live in fear. We need to make a collective effort to change this.

It’s a good reminder of how far women have come and how we are yet to go; the portrayal of this concept through the “work/study from home” mode is creative. A worthwhile watch indeed!

Really well made! A very good message has been communicated. Every woman should stand for herself and make her own identity. She should be responsible and confident for every step she moves ahead in her life and should try to reach her goal. Hearty congratulations to each one of you in making this video. Loved the last where the whole women's team switches on their videos.✌️👍💃💃👏👏👏
